## :bookmark: introduction


Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial task in text mining that involves classifying entities into different types such as person, location, organization, etc. NER can play a pivotal role as a pre-processing stage for various tasks, including question answering.
Traditionally, NER systems have been divided into two main categories: classic approach and statistical approach. In the classic approach, handcrafted rules are constructed to perform the NER task. However, more recently, there has been a growing interest in statistical approaches, driven by the advancements in deep neural networks.

## :bookmark: Problem:
Given the wide variety of deep learning algorithms, choosing an appropriate algorithm for a problem is a significant part of the research in this area. Therefore, a part of the research in this field focuses on comparing different algorithms to identify the one that performs better in solving a problem. Since natural language processing is one of the important areas of artificial intelligence and deep learning, this project aims to compare various deep learning algorithms and RNN networks on a Persian dataset. The goal is to implement multiple models for an NER (Named Entity Recognition) project and determine the best architecture based on the accuracy of the designed models

## :bookmark: Datasets
The dataset includes 250,015 tokens and 7,682 Persian sentences in total. It is available in 3 folds to be used in turn as training and test sets. Each file contains one token, along with its manually annotated named-entity tag, per line. Each sentence is separated with a newline. The NER tags are in IOB format.

According to the instructions provided to the annotators, NEs are categorized into six classes: person, organization (such as banks, ministries, embassies, teams, nationalities, networks and publishers), location (such as cities, villages, rivers, seas, gulfs, deserts and mountains), facility (such as schools, universities, research centers, airports, railways, bridges, roads, harbors, stations, hospitals, parks, zoos and cinemas), product (such as books, newspapers, TV shows, movies, airplanes, ships, cars, theories, laws, agreements and religions), and event (such as wars, earthquakes, national holidays, festivals and conferences); other are the remaining tokens.
