## :bookmark: introduction


Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial task in text mining that involves classifying entities into different types such as person, location, organization, etc. NER can play a pivotal role as a pre-processing stage for various tasks, including question answering.
Traditionally, NER systems have been divided into two main categories: classic approach and statistical approach. In the classic approach, handcrafted rules are constructed to perform the NER task. However, more recently, there has been a growing interest in statistical approaches, driven by the advancements in deep neural networks.

This project focuses on the development of three deep learning models specifically tailored for NER in the Persian language. The accuracies of these models are compared to evaluate their performance.
